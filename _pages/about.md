I'm a second year undergraduate student from School of Mathemetic Sciences, Fudan University. My research interests includes LLM, Reinforcement Learning and Operation Reasearch.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Hongning Wang] of CoAI Lab from [School of Computer Science], Tshinghua University.
