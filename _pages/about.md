I'm a second year undergraduate student from School of Mathemetic Sciences, Fudan University. My research interests includes LLM, Reinforcement Learning and High Dimentional Probability.

I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Hongning Wang of CoAI Lab from Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tshinghua University.
